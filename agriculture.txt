AGRICULTURE

We have stored information about various crops with their respective Soil
type, Season and crop type i.e. Cash or food. First of all the user will
enter details as per his preferred conditions mentioned above. Then we will 
take out the intersection of the crops estimated from each set of information
resulting to the most compatible crop. 

The overall representation of the code goes below:
1. Storing the crops with the help of multi-dimensional array.
2. Using it's index for the indentification of crops to perform further
required operations.
3. Storing all the crops(by their indexes) manually by making respective new
arrays for each specifications soil type,season and crop type.
4. Take inputs of soil type, season and crop type by user.
5. Select the right array by if-else-if-else/switch statement for all 3 inputs.
6. Take out the intersection of those 3 arrays and store the result in a new array.
7. If the intersection is not-null,Convert the indexes to crops and display them on screen.
8. If the intersection is null,Ask user to compormise and drop one of the input.
9. Repeat the whole process using those two inputs.




CODE:
input: soil type     season      cash/food
1:     clay           rabi        yes      
processing-- clay-  {1,5,6,8}  {7,4,2,6,5}  {5,7,6}
we will make a function and take out the intersection 
the result is {5,6}


For storing data type:
1: Crops and numbers assigned
2. rice=01 wheat=02 tea=03..........
   for soil type if (clay) -> 1,5,7,4,2,5
   for season ............................
   for cash .............................

   intersection 

   convert 01- rice and simultaneously.

   for(int i=0; i<count; i++){
       j=chararray[j]}

if(j==5) cout<<wheat;
