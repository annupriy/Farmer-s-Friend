# Farmer-s-Friend
The selection of crops can be a bit chaotic for some farmers. 
Temperature and rainfall changes are expected to significantly have negative impact on wide range of agricultural activities for the next few decades. 
With the changing of climate, agriculture faces increasing problems with extreme weather events leading to considerable yield losses of crops

Hence we present you the Farmer's Friend. 
The program has a simple interface and takes information on three parameters- weather, soil type and crop type from the farmer according to his priorities 
and provides information about the best suitable crop to his priorities.

**You can see its detailed presentation in the ppt given.**
